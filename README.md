Uses bouncing circles to create melodies with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a unique melody generator based on simply 2D physics. Each circle contains its own pitch and changes colors whenever it collides with another wall or object. During collision you will hear the circle's pitch. In the case of two circles colliding you will hear two pitches.
